# Sanctum/Flutter authentication example: App

A Flutter app that authenticates with the [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sanctum) package.

This project is only intended to demonstrate what Sanctum can do. It is not recommended to use it as a model for your own Flutter projects.

Before starting, add your API's URL to the `lib/utils/constants.dart` file.
